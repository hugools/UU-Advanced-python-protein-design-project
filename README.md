# UU-Advanced-python-protein-design-project
I will try to set up a workflow for refinement of my protein design based on the python packages
RFDiffusion (https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion) and ProteinMPNN (https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN).
Both the input protein structures and the verification of output structures will utilize Alphafold 2.
