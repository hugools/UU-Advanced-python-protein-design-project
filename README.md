# UU-Advanced-python-coding-project
For this project I have made three scripts which plot three different kinds of graphs that I frequently
encounter in my research and have in the past spent a lot of time plotting. Additionally, some basic 
calculations can be made based on the data. For this I utilize many of the concepts from the course, 
such as pandas, matplotlib, scipy, numpy, etc. 

I have tried the scripts using recently produced data of mine, and it does indeed save a lot of time.
